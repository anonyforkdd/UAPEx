1. Dependencies should be installed using the following command before training:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Data description:

       Publicly available Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Taxi trip Data
   from

   https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

       We provide the pre-processed toy dataset of 84 time steps from 2019/4/09 0:00 a.m. to 2019/4/16 0:00 a.m.

   in ./data/ (2 hours per time step), including:

   ----train_data.npy   The OD flows for training from Yellow Taxi records in sparse representation.

                        The sparse OD matrix of each time step is a [Index, Value] list.

                        Index = [(i_1,j_1),...,(i_k,j_k)], Value = [A_{i_1,j_1},...,A_{i_k,j_k}].

                        (70% of the whole existed OD pairs of Yellow Taxi)

   ----val_data.npy     The OD flows of the last time steps for validation.

                        (10% of the whole existed OD pairs of Yellow Taxi)

   ----test_data.npy    The OD flows of the last time steps for testing.

                        (20% of the whole existed OD pairs of Yellow Taxi)

   ----green_data.npy   The OD flows for training from Green Taxi records


3. Here are commands for training the model on NYC Taxi.

   python train.py


4. Evaluation.

   python eval.py --checkpoints ./nyc/checkpoints

5. Explainer.

   For current explanations: python exp.py --task 0
   For historical explanations: python exp.py --task 1
